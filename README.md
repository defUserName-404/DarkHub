Personally I found the GitHub Default Dark color theme very appealing but could not give up on the 
syntax highlighting of Default Dark+ theme that VS Code ships with. So I decided to create my theme on my own combining them both. 



## How to install the theme
### 1.  On Linux:
* Go to the terminal and type:
	`cd ~/.vscode/extension`
* Enter the following command:
	`git clone https://github.com/defUserName-404/DarkHub.git`
* Open VS Code and press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> and start typing *"color theme"*
* Select _"DarkHub"_ 

**Enjoy!**
